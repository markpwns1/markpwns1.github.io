                        "An ongoing project of mine, LIGMAScript is highly sophisticated optimising compiler for an original programming language that compiles to Lua. LIGMA stands for Lua-Interoperable General Machine Abstraction. The compiler is implemented in Javascript, running on Node, but I plan to port it or distribute it on a lighter Javascript engine. The language itself is quite stable, I'm just currently working on a standard library and a fleshed-out command-line interface for the compiler.",
                        "LIGMAScript fills the niche of a highly ergonomic, dynamically typed functional language that targets Lua. Its notable features are a lightweight file-based module system, extremely accurate error messages, runtime Lua errors that point to lines in the original source code, and an extremely powerful pattern matching system, more powerful than Haskell's. In addition, I've written and maintained a VSCode extension and Language Server alongside the compiler, which provides syntax highlighting, autocompletion, error reporting, and other features.",
                        "Among the optimisations it employs are pattern branch optimisation and dead code elimination. Feel free to visit the repo, where I have extremely detailed documentation on the language and its features, which I think you'll find quite impressive (particularly pattern matching)."

Usually I would go to image boards and search there, but there are many different image boards with different content, and each of them have different tags to search and different capabilities. Many of their features are locked behind a paywall, and their frontends are absolutely abysmal on desktop, and have no support for mobile whatsoever.",
                        "My solution was a mobile-optimised webapp to replace their frontend, that aggregates the results of the 3 websites together, shows you and autocompletes tags for each website, allows you to search with a uniform syntax, supports Discord embeds, and most importantly, circumvents all their paywalls.",
                        "How I did it was I made a frontend using HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery (it needed to be lightweight for mobile devices) and then a system where you could swap out middleware for each website. The middleware would handle the API calls and other things per-website. Most of their APIs would only allow access for their own frontend, so I wrote a server in JS using Node and Express to act as a proxy for the APIs, then hosted it on Heroku and just had my client connect to that server. The proxy would act like a Firefox browser connected to their front-end by mimicking the headers that would normally be sent under those circumstances. They also did not allow hotlinking, so I wrote a proxy for that the same way.",
                        "As for circumventing the paywall, how it works is that unless you paid, the website would only allow you to search 2 tags. So I wrote a system that would select the 2 least common tags in your search (which would be the most specific tags) and then search for them, and then filter the results by the other tags you searched for. This way, you could search for as many tags as you wanted, and it would only count as 2 tags.",
                        "As for listing all the tags for each website in an autocomplete format, I had to reverse-engineer the websites' frontends to find out how they were getting their tag lists. One website just has an autocomplete API, which was simple enough, and the others had a tag summary API endpoint which would give you a list of tags and their counts, and it was up to the frontend to cache them and filter them. So I wrote a system to do exactly that, for all 3 websites, including the one with an autocomplete API, so that I could have a uniform autocomplete system for all 3 websites.",
                        "Booring is actually quite complex, and needless to say there are some details I left out of the explanation, like Discord embed support and Pixiv Ugoira file format support, but that's a high-level explanation of most of the most important systems."

Hopefully from the screenshots, you'll agree that I delivered! The game is a standard taxi game where you drive around and pick up passengers and drop them off at their destination. The twist, however, is that you are in a disorienting surreal hellscape, the passengers make no sense, and you can perform stunts for absolutely no in-game benefit (but everyone still does it anyway). The soundtrack was created by the most talented musician I know, who demanded we create a dynamic soundtrack with different instruments blending in and out depending on the circumstances, and it all comes together to make an extremely relaxing experience, one that tends to hypnotise you. You have to play it to really understand.",

For example, the theme 'together' would probably have us write 'link, chain, partner, ...'. Sometimes these words will inspire sentences, and some of those sentences will transform into game mechanics, and some of those will in turn become full game pitches. We pick the most promising pitch based on both fun-ness and our time constraint and resources, preferring to be realistic about what we can accomplish in 48 hours.",
                        "After that, we start assigning informal roles (it is a game jam after all, everyone does everything). I was put in charge of art direction and terrain generation. Before everyone got to work, we straightened out our idea and created an asset list for the artists and musicians to make, including a list of 3D models, textures, sound effects, etc. needed for the game, and until we got those, the programmers would have to use cube placeholders. Once things got going, we worked together on the project by hopping in and out of a Discord call, which always contained a few of us at any given time, and using Git as version control and Trello as a to-do list. Due to our talented team and disciplined planning phase, the game went off without a hitch, and we actually had so much extra time that we added the ability to perform stunts for no reason, which increased the fun factor by a lot.",

                        "What I have so far is a reasonably advanced flight simulator relying solely on physics and no unrealistic tricks to keep flight stable--the flight is stable by itself. It takes into account things like angle of attack, air density at differing altitudes, the ground effect, pilot G-force tolerance, etc.",
                        "The terrain engine is a step up from the one in Naffta, and uses similar chunk system, but with many more tricks to get it to support terrain up to hundreds of kilometres away in-engine (though the world itself is scaled down for gameplay purposes). The terrain data is sampled from a real-world heightmap of the Middle East region and then procedurally modified to add more detail, and then flooded. Among the tricks it uses are multithreaded, frame-distributed chunk loading, LODs, distant fog, and a retro art style such that seeing that mountains are a little pointy (as with super far LODs) wouldn't be out of place.",
                        "As for the clouds, I've used similarly clever tricks. The clouds are a hybrid of raytraced and billboards. I chose this rather than completely 2D solutions like billboards or sprite-stacking, which I've used in other games, because those solutions only look good if you can control the angle that the player is viewing the clouds from. Being a flight game, the player may be at any angle to the clouds and can literally fly through them. So clouds are raytraced up to 800 metres from the camera, and then a horizontal billboard spanning the whole world is drawn at cloud height and rendered after 800m. This works out because the only way you'd be able to see them is from far above the clouds, so they still look good. In practice, this system looks just as good as raytrace-only clouds, and is much more performant.",
                        "I take art direction very seriously, so the game (as with most of my games) is rendered at genuine low resolution, and upscaled without any filtering. In addition, the colours are restricted and a faux-dithering effect is applied, which is easier on the eyes than real dithering. The art direction extends beyond post-processing too, with intentionally low-poly terrain and models, and fake shadows via black textures on a quad hovering above the ground (as seen in the 3rd screenshot).",

The grass sways gently from the wind (minor warping applied from a noise texture) and the grass obscures things inside it, which is accomplished by special shaders for the dogs and cats that sample the height of the grass from a pregenerated texture and obscure themselves accordingly. There were also some issues with platform differences, such as the grass shader swaying on a per-game-pixel basis in-editor and on Windows (correct behaviour) but a per-screen-pixel basis in the WebGL build, which I had to fix.",

The game is a real-time strategy game where your units (and enemies) move to the beat. You play as robots who have to defend their base from the evil humans. Your units can only operate in range of pylons, which you can construct, and you can also construct miners to collect crystals to build more pylons and units, and fighters, to fight off the unreasonably hostile humans.",
